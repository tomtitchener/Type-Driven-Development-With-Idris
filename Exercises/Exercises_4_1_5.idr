-- An integer arithmetic expression can take one of the following forms:
-- A single integer
-- Addition of an expression to an expression
-- Subtraction of an expression from an expression
-- Multiplication of an expression with an expression
-- Define a recursive data type Expr which can be used to represent such expressions.
-- (Hint: Look at the Picture data type and see how the informal description mapped to the data declaration.)
-- Write a function evaluate : Expr -> Int which evaluates an integer arithmetic expression.

-- Generalize.  NaÃ¯ve impl runs into trouble with Nat as an instance of Num and 'a - b' for Nat requring a > b.  
-- Is there a Num equivalent for signed numbers where Nat wouldn't be a member?  Yes:  Neg.
